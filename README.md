## This is no longer needed. Google voice app has a multi delete function now.

# Google Voice Deleter

This project opens google voice in a Chromium browser and deletes messages one by one. You might want to *Archive* the messages you want to keep before running this. 

  - Download the Chromium browser if you don't have it.
  - Set up a temp dir for user profile. Re-use it across multiple executions of the program
  - After the browser starts for the fist time, kill the program and then login to google account in that browser. This saves the Google session for multiple executions. 

This snippet does not allow enough time for the web app to load more messages. If you found a way to do it, send me a pull request.
